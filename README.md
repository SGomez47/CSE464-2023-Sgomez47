Project for CSE464 course at ASU

CSE464 focuses on software unit testing using JUnit and GitHub, emphasizing the application of various testing methods for map trees. 
The course covered testing techniques such as functional, model-based, and structure-based testing. Learning automated unit testing and test-driven development to ensure code quality. 
Implementation includes using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. The course also introduced A/B testing to compare different software versions effectively.
